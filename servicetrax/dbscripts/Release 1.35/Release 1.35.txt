Version 1.35b [1579]

This is updated to reflect the correct SQL script run order.  Also, the quote_standard_conditions.sql and
standard_conditions_data.sql were changed so their depedencies are in the correct order.

Scripts should be run in the following order:

standard_conditions.sql
standard_conditions_data.sql

requests.sql
quote_workstation_configurations.sql
quote_standard_conditions.sql
quote_specify_other_services.sql
quote_other_furniture.sql
quote_other_furniture_ad_hoc.sql
quotes.sql
versions_copy_v.sql
