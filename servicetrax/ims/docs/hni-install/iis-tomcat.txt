A. Set up Tomcat

1. Edit d:\tomcat5.0\conf\workers2.properties
	Change the examples section to look like this:
	[uri:/ims/*]
	info=ServiceTrax.
	context=/ims

2. Check that the AJP/1.3 connector is listening:
  netstat -na | findstr 8009
  TCP    0.0.0.0:8009           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  
  If it is not running, make certain the line in the file d:\tomcat5.0\conf\server.xml
   <Connector port="8009" enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" protocol="AJP/1.3" />
  is not commented out.

3. Check the registry for the ISAPI redirector settings.
   The settings should look similar (depending on the installation folders) to the following.
   Make certain the workers.properties file listed in A.1. is in the same location indicated
   by workersFile below.
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Jakarta Isapi Redirector\2.0]
"workersFile"="D:\\Tomcat5.0\\conf\\workers2.properties"
"extensionUri"="/jakarta/isapi_redirector2.dll"
"logLevel"="debug"
"serverRoot"="D:\\Tomcat5.0\\"



B. OPTIONAL - Create a web site definition in IIS for ServiceTrax if not using Default Web Site

1. Bring up the IIS Manager

2. Right click on the Web Sites -> New -> Web Site...

	Description: ServiceTrax
	Enter IP address: <specific IP address>
	
	Path to home directory:
		D:\web


C. Create a virtual directory (or set up Default Web Site)

1. In IIS Manager

2. Right click on new ServiceTrax web site

3. New -> Virtual Directory
	Alias: jakarta
	Path: d:\Tomcat5.0\bin\win32\i386
	
4. on Virtual Directory Access Permissions
	check "Execute (such as ISAPI applications or CGI)
	
5. Now in the properties for the 'ims' virtual directory confirm:
	
	- "Script source access" is checked
	- "Read" access is checked
	- The Execute Permissions is set to "Scripts and Executables"
	- The "Local Path" points to the bin directory of the Jakarta Isapi Redirector 
	
6.You will also need to make sure that the non-default website has the Jakarta Redirector installed unless it is already installed
  at the global Web Sites level. This can be done by right-clicking on the non-default website, 
  clicking 'properties' and then clicking on the "ISAPI Filters" tab.

  From here you will need to:

   - Click the "Add..." button
   - Enter a filter name: jakarta
   - Browse to the "isapi_redirector2.dll" file located here: d:\Tomcat5.0\bin\win32\i386
   - Click OK, Apply and then OK. 

7. In IIS Manager right-click Web Service Extensions and then click Add a new web service extension.  
   Call the new extension Tomcat and then browse to D:\Tomcat5.0\bin\win32\i386\isapi_redirector2.dll 
   and the click OK, click Set extension status to allowed and then click OK.

8. The final step is to restart the IIS Server.
