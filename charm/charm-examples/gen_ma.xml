<!-- 
The DOCTYPE declaration declares the location of product-specific parts of the
Ant build file. You can change the values of these declarations to point to
other available files. This gives you an opportunity to choose what database
and EJB container to use for the Middlegen samples.

Note that this syntax has nothing to do with Ant or Middlegen. This
is the standard way defined by w3c to dynamically include external
files in an XML document. Any decent XML parser will do the include
transparently. Try to open this file in Internet Explorer and see
for yourself.
